    "### Log\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I did was fetch the data: production data for 2022–2024 and consumption data for 2021–2024. I had some trouble with database connections and setting up the MongoDB collections correctly, but eventually got it working. Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted the existing 2021 data in MongoDB, so I had to go back to CA2 and reload it. After that, I adjusted the code so it wouldn’t clear the table before inserting new data. Later, I discovered that some column names were not in lowercase, which caused many null values in the database. I fixed the naming issues and downloaded all the data again using consistent lowercase columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I updated the spectrogram and weather plots to use Plotly instead of Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I started implementing the map page. I downloaded the GeoJSON data for the price areas and used the lecture code as a starting point. After that, I added UI elements to let the user choose an energy production/consumption group and a time interval (in days). The map then colours the price areas based on the mean values for the selected settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the map, I moved on to the snow drift task. I used the Snow_drift module with some modifications. I chose the bonus exercise, plotting the monthly snow drift together with the seasonal snow drift. I struggled with aligning the time frames and making the plot work correctly. My solution was to repeat the seasonal average 12 times to match the monthly data. Then I adjusted the visuals. The plot shows one year before the period for seasonal drift and one year after for both monthly and seasonal. It was harder than expected. The plot should now be correct if you look away from the first and last year (one year before and one year after the period we actually are investigating).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I implemented the sliding window correlation with selectable lag and window size. Using the lecture material and some help from ChatGPT, this part went fairly smoothly. I played with the controls and checked if I could spot any changes in correlations in normal conditions and in/after extreme weather events. The findings are reported later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I worked on the SARIMAX model. Fitting the model took a very long time and often crashed. I therefore decided to aggregate the data to one value per day. This made the model run much faster. The predictions were not very accurate, especially for production, but consumption gave slightly better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end, I reorganised the app slightly. I moved the LineChartColumn showing the first month of data to the weather page. I also rearranged the pages so the energy-related pages come first, then weather, and finally the weather–energy correlation page.\n",
    "\n",
    "My app is quite slow, especially the maps page, likely due to limited experience with caching. I tried to implement caching but probably not well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I found this assignment very challenging and time-consuming. I managed to solve all the tasks in some way, but I know the app is far from perfect. Still, this is my first app ever, and I’m satisfied with what I achieved given my knowledge and time. I learned a lot during this course and also realised how much more there is to learn."

    "### AI usage\n",
    "AI was used extensively throughout this project, primarily through ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in VS Code. I leveraged AI to generate code suggestions, adapt examples from lectures, and refine solutions for specific tasks. For instance, when implementing the Sliding Window Correlation, I combined code snippets from lectures with AI-generated suggestions, then iteratively adjusted and tested the code until it functioned correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used AI to interpret error messages and propose potential fixes. By testing different solutions suggested by ChatGPT, I was able to identify the most effective approach. For parameter selection in the various analysis functions, such as the SARIMAX forecasting and the sliding window correlation, ChatGPT provided guidance. The interactive nature of the Streamlit app made it easy to experiment with different parameters, and AI guidance accelerated this process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond coding, I also used ChatGPT to refine and improve the wording in this notebook, ensuring clarity and readability.\n",

    "### Meteorology and energy production: Sliding Window Correlation findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the years, we observe a clear correlation between temperature and energy consumption. In summer, higher temperatures are associated with lower energy consumption, likely due to reduced heating demand. Conversely, in winter, colder temperatures coincide with increased energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the extreme weather event Hans in August 2023, there was a strong negative correlation between wind speed and energy production in price area NO5 (western Norway). This effect, observed with zero lag and a 48-hour rolling window, is likely due to operational constraints or grid-balancing measures that limited wind power output during the storm.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, there was a positive correlation between precipitation and energy production, using a 48-hour window with a 48-hour lag. This suggests that the heavy rainfall contributed to increased hydro reservoir levels, which subsequently boosted hydroelectric generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings illustrate how extreme weather events can temporarily alter the typical relationships between meteorological variables and energy production. At the same time, some correlations may be coincidental, so interpretations should be made with caution."
